        "explanation": "The Great Nebula in Orion, an immense, nearby starbirth region, is probably the most famous of all astronomical nebulas. Here, glowing gas surrounds hot young stars at the edge of an immense interstellar molecular cloud only 1500 light-years away. In the deep featured image assigned false colors, emission from oxygen and hydrogen is mapped to blue and green, with sulfur and hydrogen emission in red. Particularly apparent is the Trapezium cluster of four massive stars near the center. The Orion Nebula is found in the same spiral arm of our Galaxy as the Sun.",

        "explanation": "What's happening in the center of spiral galaxy NGC 1097? No one is sure, but it likely involves a supermassive black hole. Matter falling in forms an accretion disk that heats up and glows brightly. The featured image, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, resolves the central 1000 light-years of the galaxy in infrared light. The central black hole is thought to be about 100 million times the mass of our Sun.",
